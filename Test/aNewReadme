# My Process for Part 1
## Step 1:
I forked the course repository by using the "fork" button in the top right corner of the ds4ph-bme page
## Step 2:
I created a new directory called "Test" in the repo by creating a new file and making the name "Test/"
## Step 3:
I created a new file "aNewReadme.md" within the test directory and typed this with markdown syntax
